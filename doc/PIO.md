## Theory
We know that in a density matrix, the diagonal elements indicate the "population" of bases and the off-diagonal elements indicate the "interaction" between pairs of bases. Similarly, if we put bases into groups by the atoms they come from, the diagonal blocks indicate the "population" of atoms and the off-diagonal blocks indicate the "interaction" between pairs of atoms. Again, if we put bases into groups by the fragments they come from, the diagonal blocks indicate the "population" of fragments and the off-diagonal blocks indicate the "interaction" between pairs of fragments.
